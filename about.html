                        <p>crit is hard! especially if everyone has different linguistic and cultural backgrounds. how can we create new communities where people of different backgrounds feel free to share and discourse?</p>

                        <p>pratt institute, and the larger design community in general, are international spaces. the way we talk about design, however, is not in several ways. an important function of critique is to create a community and environment where students and professors are able to discuss not only presented work, but how design <i>works</i>. when students are from so many different contexts, we need to find ways to create these environments that can also celebrate the diversity of their constituents.</p>
