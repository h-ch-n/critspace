                        <p>"Some words used for design projects are not understandable."</p>
                    </h4>	
                    <h3>
                        <p>Large crits work well in terms of addressing issues and areas of interest that relate to the entire class, but time constraints (and the necessity of catering to the needs of more than just the person being critiqued) make it hard, especially for students who are introverted or struggle with English, to get the clarification they need. Often it is still hard for people who have a technical knowledge of a language to wade through colloquialisms and terminology in front of a crowd.</p>
                        <p>A problem with larger critiques is keeping most of the group engaged in the conversation, and many times it devolves into less of a conversation or discussion and more into a professor and one or two students giving opinions.</p>
                    </h3>
                    <h4>
                        <p>"You can see everyone's work but it turns into the professor droning on and on and students space out."</p>
                    </h4>
                    <h3>
                        <p>Large critiques can work in conjunction with a variety of other critique forms and sizes, and may work better as a summative checkpoint rather than a set-in-stone standard for how critiques are run.</p>
                    </h3>
                    <h4>
                        <p>"[It's] nice that you get to see people's work... you can sometimes get helpful feedback from professors and other people, but people get really tired and don't really talk. Also, time distribution can be really uneven."</p>
                    </h4>
                    <h3>
                        <p>Calling people out or putting them on the spot are not necessarily productive ways to engage large groups of students. An unexpected "spotlight" can trip up speakers, both those who are native English speakers and those who are English learners.</p>
