                        <p>"[You get] more feedback, but less good quality feedback because people feel more comfortable but you don't have a moderator."</p>

                        <p>Smaller groups can help create a more comfortable and more casual environment for students to share work with their peers. For non-native English speakers, this can mean more latitude to clarify other students' comments without feeling the extra scrutiny that comes with speaking in front of a large group. The informal structure allows for more personal feedback but still allows for contact and feedback from the professor (without needing to consider the critique needs of as large a group of students).</p>
                        <p>Breaking into small groups is also helpful for building rapport between classmates, since the more casual format can help to start conversations between students of different backgrounds. A potential downfall with small groups is the lack of consistent moderation and the potential (as in whole-class critiques) of one student dominating the discussion. </p>

                        <p>Small groups that are checked in on (with a professor rotating between groups, setting time limits and switching groups up, or with a regrouping element at the end) tend to be perhaps more productive and face fewer of the problems that are commonly noticed.</p>
