					<h3>
                            <p>One-on-ones are a good way to address specific problems students are facing or that they haven't had the chance to articulate properly in class. Some students who aren't as confident in their English have preferred to ask questions individually. A one-on-one structure offers the chance to receive more guidance or more personalized feedback. This structure also means that a student doesn't get as diverse of a critique on their work, and that students aren't necessarily sharing what they are doing with each other.</p>
                    </h3>
                    <h4>
                        <p>"Nice that you can get direct feedback, but if you only do one-on-ones you don't get a variety of feedback. You are only engaged for a short bit which can be good or bad. You're not as engaged for as long because even if you're supposed to be working sometimes you're not. I feel like it's more helpful at the beginning [of a project] than at the end."</p>
                    </h4>
                    <h3>
                            <p>These feedback sessions help build relationships between professor and student, which once established can help promote more comfortable communication in larger group settings as well. One-on-ones work well as check-ins to clarify questions and concepts discussed in whole-class or small-group settings, as well as to gauge where students are in terms of classroom needs. It might be helpful to discuss what previous classroom experiences are and what seems to work for NNS students, as what has been productive for them in classrooms before may not be what has been the case in many classrooms in America.</p>
